My work on OpenFOAM : cases I developed, work on wind effects or tools for enhancing post-treatment

FILE Trees-simulation-different-porosities

During my internship at Ingerop (Paris), I was working without any interface on OpenFOAM and worked directly within the files of a project. In this project I aimed to simulate trees with different porosities. I thus included stl files representing trees, through the file "constant". I had different sizes of trees. I then applied the porosity to each of them.
