I present my work with OpenFOAM : cases I developed, work on wind effects or tools for enhancing post-treatment. Not all my work will be posted here as much of it was developed in order to enhance a company's productivity and thus remain quite confidential.

FILE Trees-simulation-different-porosities

During my internship at Ingerop (Paris), I was working without any interface on OpenFOAM and worked directly within the files of a project. In this project I aimed to simulate trees with different porosities. I thus included stl files representing trees, through the file "constant". I had different sizes of trees. I then applied the porosity to each of them. 


FILE White-book-wind-effects-French

During my internship at Elioth, I started to develop a White book with wind effects that often occur in urban area depending on the shape, the position and the orientation of a building. In this file is one part of this White Book. I did simulations on OpenFOAM to illustrate the problems. This document is currently in French in the moment as it was firstly developed in a French company.
