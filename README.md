I present my work with OpenFOAM : cases I developed, work on wind effects or tools for enhancing post-treatment. Not all my work will be posted here as much of it was developed in order to enhance a company's productivity and thus remain quite confidential.

FILE Scripts-automation-wind-comfort-mapping_FRENCH

This file contains scripts in order to automate the calculation of wind comfort mapping. Having different OpenFOAM calculations, where each direction is representing a direction of wind, it is possible to show in ParaView the combination of these directions and show where there are uncomfortable areas in the urban environment. 
These scripts, as well as the files names are in French as it was developed during my Master Thesis in Paris. A translation and modification of my codes towards English will come in the future.
I also developed a tutorial besides of the codes as well as explanations of my different codes, in order to make it easy for my previous team to use it when needed. These files will be uploaded soon, but are unfortunately also in French for the moment.  

FILE Trees-simulation-different-porosities

During my internship at Ingerop (Paris), I was working without any interface on OpenFOAM and worked directly within the files of a project. In this project I aimed to simulate trees with different porosities. I thus included stl files representing trees, through the file "constant". I had different sizes of trees. I then applied the porosity to each of them. 


FILE White-book-wind-effects-French

During my internship at Elioth, I started to develop a White book with wind effects that often occur in urban area depending on the shape, the position and the orientation of a building. In this file is one part of this White Book. I did simulations on OpenFOAM to illustrate the problems. This document is currently in French in the moment as it was firstly developed in a French company.
